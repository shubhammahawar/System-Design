Functional Requirements :
a. only for users with account
   Each user = 1 account = 1 free burger
b. 30M active user on app, however 20M will take part in this campaign or try and claim free burger.
c. Any user above 6M will get "SORRY" message.
d. All user information  already existing in user table/service
e. Banner/Button popup on screen.
f. Assignment/Distribution of burger - FIFO
g. Geographically Confined : If  its a global level - then issue of trcking tracking data at multiple data centre along with multiple languages.

Non-Functional Requirements :
Infrastructure already exists in terms of distributed counter - lets discuss it more.
supports for clients - mobile and web.
High Availability
Low Latency
System should be scalable and efficient
Slightly under acceptable [ For those who do not accept ? assign exactly 6M]


Estimation :

Traffic:
20M request per 10 minute -> i.e 20*10^6 /(60*10) -> 35K rps

Bandwidth:
35K request coming each second and each request is of size 1Kb (1000 bytes) i.e
35000*1000bytes = 3.5MB/second
